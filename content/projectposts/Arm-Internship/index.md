description: '3 month summer placement at Arm as a Python software developer'
---

I spent three months as an intern at ARM where I worked on open-source code providing benchmarking tools for largely mobile devices.
Although I had used Python before, it was not in any comprehensive manner, so the placement provided me a solid experience to learn and solidify core concepts in Python that has proven itself to be useful many times over, especially in streamlining work done since in Machine Learning.

The placement was remote and motivated the practice of useful communicative skills accordingly, centered on clear and explicit text correspondence.
Similarly, I learned the proper management of Git logs and the creation concise and useful GitHub commit messages.

The repositories[^1] were large and well established, so it was important to quickly understand initially the broader strokes of the architecture, especially as I began to implement changes that at first seemed to allow multiple possible realisations.
Communicating with the users of the software was essential to understand the key use cases and inform on the best solutions, whilst providing data to prove their suitability and performance.
