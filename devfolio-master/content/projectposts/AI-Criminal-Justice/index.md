description: "An essay on AI's implications in the criminal justice system"
---

As part of an extracurricular course on ‘Conflict, Crime and Justice’ I researched the potential implications of AI in the criminal justice system.[^1]
It is all too common to see new and promising inventions causing harmful outcomes, and often with AI this is due to a lack of care and diligence in its implementation and restriction.
Having experienced within university a largely neutral standpoint on engineering and its applications it was refreshing to explore the ever-growing moral and ethical issues created with modern AI, besides the frequent panic-laden stories in the news.

My findings revolved around uncertainty and the ability to express, or at least find it, in a model.
It is important for AI systems, used in situations where their decision is weighed as a factor, that their outputs be qualified by a level of confidence.
Many practitioners have assumed that classical training schemes naturally calibrate models that embed a calibrated measure of confidence in their output, but recent focused research has shown this to not be the case. 
If models are to be useful in courtroom decisions, then these outputs must be able to reliably self-assess.

The lie detector was originally drawn into the courtroom as a means of providing unbiased opinions,[^2] and whilst its objectiveness was questioned and its use as a evidence ultimately invalidated, the same has not happened to many of the - often hand-tuned - algorithms that play a role in determining guilt or risk of defendants and convicts.
These are no less subjective than their creators design them to be, but this is hidden behind their apparent machine impartiality. 
More complex algorithms are making their way into predictive policing strategies, making it ever more important that their limitations are thoroughly understood.

I believe that all AI practitioners should be more aware of their models' potential societal impacts, and look forward to following the debate as AI develops further.
